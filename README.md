About the dataset

Aspiring Minds' Employability Outcomes 2015 (AMEO 2015), a unique dataset which provides engineering graduates' employment outcomes (salaries, job titles and job locations) together with standardized assessment scores in three fundamental areas - cognitive skills, technical skills and personality. Coupled with biodata information, AMEO 2015 provides an opportunity for a unique and comprehensive study of the entry level labor market.

The dataset used for this project was taken from the "IKDD CoDS 2016 Data Challenge" which can be found here: http://research.aspiringminds.com/resources/ameo
